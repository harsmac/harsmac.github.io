            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project investigates how large language models organize information within their embedding
                spaces. We discovered that a small number of latent directions capture the majority of
                discriminative power, enabling efficient adversarial attacks and interpretability analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The methodology involves principal component analysis on hidden representations, probing for
                susceptibility to perturbations and visualizing the resulting subspaces. Our experiments show
                that focusing on these subspaces significantly reduces the dimensionality required for model
                manipulation without sacrificing performance.

                Here you can dive into the technical details of the approach. Provide experimental results,
                evaluation metrics, and visualizations. Explain how the subspaces were identified, how the
                adversarial examples were generated and discuss the trade‑offs encountered.
